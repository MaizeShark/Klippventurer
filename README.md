This repo, supported features, and guides change often, join our Discord or watch the repo for updates.
Please open an issue or pull request if you encounter any problems with installation.

# Known Issues
- Nation N32G MCU doesn't work with current .config
- Can't currently support screen, buzzer, USB, filament runout sensor, or camera. This will be solved when the easy installer is released.
- Adventurer 3 Pro works, but you need to switch the stepper driver types from TMC2208 to TMC2209.
